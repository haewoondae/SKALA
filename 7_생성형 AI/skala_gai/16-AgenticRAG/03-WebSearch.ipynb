      "Samsung has recently launched a new mid-range smartphone in India. Besides a new camera design and sleek profile, the new Samsung Galaxy M56 brings One UI 7 out of the box and supports six years of Android and security updates.\n",
      "It’s not the first non-premium phone that’s getting the new OS pre-installed. Samsung has previously launched a few entry-level models that get the latest Android 15-based One UI 7 out of the box, while flagship owners are still waiting.\n",
      "Samsung has been working to optimize Android 15 for Galaxy devices since December 2024. The company has launched the Open Beta in early December for the Galaxy S24 series, which expanded in March to foldables and the S23 series.\n",
      "The Samsung Galaxy M56 5G will go on sale in India next week. The company highlights that the One UI 7 brings a redesigned user experience, smart new widgets, modern app icons, Now Bar for real-time updates, and core security enhancements.\n",
      "Six-gen OS upgrades make the Galaxy M56 superior to flagships like the Galaxy S21 and S22 series. While One UI 7 is the last major upgrade for the S21 series, the S22 will be reaching its end of support with the One UI 8 update.\n",
      "As for the Galaxy S23 series, this lineup is also eligible for only four generations of OS upgrades. Samsung’s new 7-year update policy is applicable on Galaxy S24 series and later flagship models including the Galaxy S25 series.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "On the flip side, the mid-range Galaxy M56 will be receiving major upgrades up to Android 21. Security updates are also promised to be delivered by up to October 2030, which could go even beyond if Samsung revises the support.\n",
      "While the S21 and S22 series were released years ago, they are still better than Samsung’s 2025 mid-ranger. Consumers have paid five times extra money, and the support isn’t what they deserve at this point, in the mid-range, getting valued.\n",

      "Using SOS+, users dial a dedicated number to share their live location with Aura’s secure system. Help is dispatched immediately, and a call-back from the control center confirms assistance is on the way. The service prioritizes speed and reliability.\n",
      "SOS+ is free for the first 12 months with the purchase of a new Samsung Galaxy A56, A36, or A26 smartphone. After the pilot trial ends, the service costs around R29 per month. The subscription service will be available starting May 1.\n",

      "Despite having Android at its core, Samsung’s One UI doesn’t join Google’s Beta Program. This year, no surprise: Samsung has skipped Google’s Android 16 Beta list, which is joined by many rivaling brands like Xiaomi.\n",
      "Google has recently released Android 16 Beta 4 for Pixel phones. It comes as the second Platform Stability release, which is almost as stable as the official release. Google also announced compatible apps can now be listed on the Play Store.\n",
      "However, Samsung’s decision to skip Google’s Beta aligns with its history of focusing on One UI. This approach lets the company “personally” refine its software, though it means Galaxy users wait longer for Android 16 previews.\n",
      "Android 16 Beta is now available on various devices from brands including Google, iQOO, Lenovo, OnePlus, Sharp, Oppo, Realme, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Honor. The new OS is available on top of the previous version of their respective custom skins.\n",
      "Source – Android Developers\n",
      "Samsung will bring Android 16 to Galaxy devices as part of One UI 8. Other Android OEMs also have their custom skins based on Android, but they usually join Google’s Android Beta Program ahead of their own skin’s testing.\n",
      "While Android 16 is getting ready for official release, Samsung has also shifted gears and has been internally testing the One UI 8. This new iteration will be unveiled with the next-gen foldables this year, and we’ve got plenty of leaks.\n",
      "One UI 8 could be a minor upgrade in comparison to One UI 7. Key interface aspects will remain similar, but we would see design tweaks across system apps such as Samsung Gallery, My Files, and Quick Share. Here’s more on One UI 8:\n",

      "In this article\n",
      "A Boeing jet earmarked for China was returning to the United States on Friday, flight tracking data showed, as the planemaker's flagship delivery plant outside Shanghai was drawn into a deepening tariff war between Beijing and Washington.\n",
      "The return of one of several jets waiting for final work and handover to a Chinese carrier at the completion center in Zhoushan is the latest sign of disruption to deliveries from a breakdown in the industry's decades-old duty-free status.\n",
      "In a sign that Boeing was preparing for normal business just weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on April 2, three new 737 Max planes had flown from Boeing in Seattle to Zhoushan in March.\n",
      "Another arrived last week at Zhoushan, where Boeing installs interiors and paints liveries before handing over to customers, according to Flightradar24 data.\n",
      "But on Friday, one of the first batch of jets took off again without being delivered and flew from Zhoushan to the U.S. territory of Guam — one of the stops such flights make as they cross the Pacific — indicating it was heading back to Seattle.\n",
      "Boeing declined to comment.\n",
      "The 5,000-mile trip back to Boeing's main factory comes as the planemaker's business in China is under scrutiny over the tariff dispute.\n",
      "Bloomberg News reported earlier this week that Boeing faced a Chinese ban on imports, part of the escalating confrontation over U.S. President Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" global tariffs.\n",
      "There has been no official comment from Beijing, or in Chinese state media.\n",
      "Senior aviation and aerospace industry sources told Reuters they were not aware of formal instructions against taking Boeing planes.\n",
      "Even so, industry sources and analysts widely agreed that the imposition of tariffs on U.S. goods by Beijing in response to Trump's actions would effectively block aircraft imports without any formal ban.\n",
      "One senior industry source said Boeing and suppliers were planning on the basis that it would not be delivering planes to China for the time being.\n",
      "Photos posted to plane-spotting websites in February showed that the repatriated plane was decorated with a livery for Xiamen Airlines, majority owned by China Southern 600029.SS.\n",
      "One source said it was expected to be delivered to Xiamen, which did not reply to a request for comment.\n",
      "Aviation publication The Air Current, which first reported the decision to withdraw some undelivered jets from Zhoushan, said one unnamed Chinese airline had separately walked away from a commitment to lease a Boeing aircraft.\n",
      "Industry sources said the return flight came despite some discussions over leaving undelivered jets in bonded storage, meaning they would not be officially imported or tariffed.\n",
      "Chinese customs did not reply to a request for comment.\n",
      "Delivery limbo\n",
      "The tariff war and apparent U-turn over deliveries come as Boeing has been recovering from an almost five-year import freeze on 737 Max jets and a previous round of trade tensions.\n",
      "Boeing opened the completion plant in Zhoushan — a major cargo hub which, together with nearby Ningbo, hosts one of the world's busiest ports — in 2018 under the shadow of a previous round of trade tensions during Trump's first presidency.\n",
      "Although Boeing has not followed Airbus in assembling full airplanes in China, analysts said the aim was to build a lead in one of the world's largest air travel markets.\n",
      "Bloomberg News also reported that Beijing has asked Chinese carriers to halt purchases of U.S.-made aircraft parts. All modern commercial jets depend heavily on such components.\n",
      "Two U.S. industry sources said they were given no clear instructions not to ship parts to China. A separate source, who runs a maintenance and repair shop for aircraft in China, said they had no issues importing American parts.\n",
      "China's foreign ministry declined to comment.\n",
      "Asked by the media about the reported bans, a spokesperson said: \"I'd refer you to competent authorities.\"\n",
      "Analysts say that confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties.\n",
      "Boeing historically sent a quarter of its deliveries to China, but this has been falling following earlier tensions, a 737 Max safety crisis, and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n",
      "Boeing data shows 130 unfilled orders for China-based airlines and lessors. Industry sources say a significant portion of the more than 760 unfilled orders for which Boeing has yet to name a buyer are destined for China.\n",
      "Analysts said a short-term halt in deliveries to China would not have an immediate major impact on Boeing, since it could serve other airlines and Airbus lacks spare capacity.\n",
